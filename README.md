House-and-Mortgage-Regression-Analysis

This report analyzes state-level housing price trends in the United States using multiple and 
binary logistic regression models. The primary objective is to understand the relationship 
between the Housing Price Index (HPI) at the state level and factors such as time (year and 
month) and national trends (us_avg). The analysis aims to identify significant factors 
influencing state-specific housing price fluctuations and to determine whether certain periods or 
states are more likely to experience housing prices above the national average. Multiple linear 
regression was used to quantify the relationships between the HPI and its predictors, while 
Binary logistic regression was employed to classify states based on whether their HPI exceeds 
the national average. 
The analysis will involve generating tables and graphs using RStudio and the R programming 
language, utilizing various libraries to support data processing, visualization, and statistical 
modeling. Any additional software or tools employed in the analysis will be explicitly 
mentioned.
